RetroRig Project for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
===================================================

Please Note!
----------------

This project is intened to be run on Ubuntu (currently 14.04 LTS) with an Xbox 360 Controller. 
At some point in the future, I want to try and branch this to other distributions if possible. 

I invite you to challenge the configs and scripts to help improve my ultimate goal to provide
an easy way to get up and running with RetroGaming on x86_64 Linux systems. Pull requests or
Issues are very much welcome!

Thank you for your patience.
