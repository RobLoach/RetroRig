RetroRig Project for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
===================================================

## Please Note!

RetroRig is shell script to setup a Linux x86_64 system  with several emulators, and XBMC as graphical 
front end.The inspiration for doing this lies almost completely with the RetroPie Project. I wanted to provide
something similar, but wanted something a bit more than RetroArch. One of my chief nags for RetroArch/RetroPie 
(as amazing as it is), is organization. Sorting through 100's of games sometimestakes a long amount of time 
(folders and help this), but I soon became addicted to how ROM Collection Browser handles games, as well as 
it's huge set of options. Among those things was seperate and easy control of each emulator, rather than a 
blanket config for the entire suite. This allows emulators to have traditional layouts (reversed buttons
for SNES, for instance). Some emulators do things better than others, and I try to adjust them accordingly. 
Who knows, I may end up using RetroArch, but hey, nobody said fun projects are all for naught, right!?

This project is intended to be run on Ubuntu (currently 14.04 LTS) with an wireless Xbox 360 Controller. 
At some point in the future, I want to try and branch this to other distributions if possible, as well
as accomodate other controllers. Please see the release-roadmap file for ideas and future plans. 

I invite you to challenge the configs and scripts to help improve my ultimate goal to provide
an easy way to get up and running with RetroGaming on x86_64 Linux systems. Pull requests or
Issues are very much welcome!

I am not a programmer by trade (I am ok with Visual Basic, Powershell, and Python), but enjoy scripting a
lot. In that respect, I have much to learn, and part of the fun of doing this, is improving upon those
skills and more.

Thank you for your patience.

## Why XBMC and Ubuntu?

I mainly made the decision to use Ubuntu+XBMC for a few reasons. First of all is XBMC itself, which can
extend far beyond retro gaming, adding many benefits if you decided to utilize XBMC further down the 
line, ensuring your computer / partition is not sitting there unused for other tasks. Another reason
was ROM Collection Browser, which in my opinion, is truly amazing at organizing your ROMs. The artwork
scrappers, importers, sorting, filtering, launch options, and more make it truly fantastic.

So then, why Ubuntu? Well, 14.04 LTS recently debuted when I decided to start this, which as many know,
provides years of updates. Additionally, Ubuntu itself is rich with PPAs, software repositories, and
forum documentation. Yes, I could have used many other distributions, but Ubuntu has a wide scope,
and is a hot target for many folks. Arch Linux, or Debian Testing were other considerations. Of course, 
there are many pro's and con's to using Ubuntu, all of which are understandable. You can't appease 
everyone!
